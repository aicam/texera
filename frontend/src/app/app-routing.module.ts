// Angular reuses the same DashboardComponent instance across all
// navigations, so its ngOnInit (and the SocialAuthService.authState
// subscription it sets up) fires exactly once — not on every visit to
// "/". Previously "/" had its own DashboardComponent route entry,
// which made the router treat "/" and "/dashboard/*" as different
// parents and tear down + recreate the chrome on each switch. That
// remount replayed the cached Google authState, re-issued a JWT, and
// bounced the user to /dashboard/user/workflow every time they clicked
// About or Logout.
